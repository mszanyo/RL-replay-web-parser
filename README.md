# Node Web Server For Parsing RL Replays

This server uses the Boxcars replay parsing library [boxcars](https://github.com/nickbabcock/boxcars). Inspiration has also been taken from repository [rl-web](https://github.com/nickbabcock/rl-web), but instead of being implemented on the frontend this solution provides a server.

This project has been included in a school project, with the objective of using open-source software, adapting it and then implementing it.
